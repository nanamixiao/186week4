## part I

the average case doesn't influence the blue part which traversal the array O(N) is setted down no matter the array is best case or worst case. The red line is N- goodpart, so the average is N * N/2,  so the answer is O(N^2)

## part II
since the index start with 1 , so the traversal is o(N-1) , if it's the wrost case, the first number will move 1 step the second will move 2 step which is O(N).
On math part (N-1)*N which N = 5 :            4  *  5 = 20. it's O(20)


## part III
### a
since no matter find or not the for loop will traversal to the end .  time complexity is O（N）

### b

I will change the foundX = true; to "return true; "  in that case the average is O(n/2) which is O(n) and best case it's o(1)
